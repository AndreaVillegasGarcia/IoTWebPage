        <h3 class='subTitle'>About IoT</h3>
        <p class ='sectionText'>
          The Internet of things (IoT) is the extension of Internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects. Embedded with electronics, Internet connectivity, and other forms of hardware (such as sensors), these devices can communicate and interact with others over the Internet, and they can be remotely monitored and controlled.
        </p>
        <p class ='sectionText'>
          The definition of the Internet of things has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", covering devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers.
        </p>
        <p class ='sectionText'>
          The IoT concept has faced prominent criticism, especially in regards to privacy and security concerns related to these devices and their intention of pervasive presence but to 50 years from now I hope we will have already passed all this barriers and have the safest IoT systems.

        <h3 class='subTitle'>Impact of IoT on the future</h3>
        <p class ='sectionText'>
          IoT is the technology that will allow the connection of billions of devices to provide innovative and smarter solutions to current problems. In the coming years the growth of IoT will translate into:

          <h3 class='subTitle'>What are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning Applications?</h3>
          <p class ='sectionText'>
            Artificial intelligence focuses on making already "intelligent" systems capable of simulating human-like decision-making and execution - enabling those systems to perform functions traditionally executed by skilled human professionals - but do so at a much higher level, because of the speed and power available on modern computing platforms.
          </p>
          <p class ='sectionText'>
            AI systems can be very simple, like business rules that replicate a simple human decision - or extremely complex - like executing real-time customer "conversations" in a call-center, while still providing a natural experience to the customer. Advances in data processing speeds, lower costs, big data volume, and the integration of data science into technology has made practical AI a reality for many organizations, and has brought it within reach of many more. Modern customer interaction systems now frequently include actual "learning" - the ability of the system to consistently improve performance through interpretation of historical patterns, actions taken, along and an understanding of what's considered a successful outcome.
